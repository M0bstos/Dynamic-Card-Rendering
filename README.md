## How it works

Card Creation:

A single card prefab is used to represent all 52 cards in the deck. The card displays its value and suit using text components.

Dynamic Card Generation:

On startup, a script dynamically instantiates 52 card objects, each with a unique value and suit. The values range from "A" to "K" and the suits are Clubs (c), Hearts (h), Spades (s), and Diamonds (d).

Card Display:

The cards are arranged in a grid layout to ensure that all 52 cards are visible simultaneously in the scene.

Card Flip Feature:

An additional feature allows cards to be flipped to reveal their back side. Clicking on any card triggers the flip animation, showcasing my name on the card's back.

Scene Initialization:

When the project is run, the scene automatically opens to display the entire deck of cards in the arranged layout.
